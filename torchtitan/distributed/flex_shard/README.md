# FlexShard

FlexShard provides PyTorch-native building blocks for running optimizer compute
with layouts that differ from persistent DTensor parameter storage layouts. It
plans packed storage-to-compute redistribution and overlaps communication with
optimizer work. DistributedMuon is its initial consumer.

## Public API

The public API is exported from `torchtitan.distributed.flex_shard`:

- `ComputeLayout` describes temporary optimizer-compute sharding on named
  `DeviceMesh` axes using PyTorch DTensor placements or `Owned`.
- `Owned` assigns a complete subgroup-local logical tensor to one dynamically
  selected rank for the compute phase.
- `BucketConfig` groups and orders parameters by fully qualified name for
  packed redistribution and communication-compute overlap.
- `MuonComputeShardingConfig` associates a parameter with its `ComputeLayout`
  and an optional logical compute view.
- `AttentionPerHeadComputeView` treats a flattened attention projection as a
  batch of independent per-head matrices for Muon.
- `build_distributed_muon` validates named DTensor parameters, plans their
  storage-to-compute transitions, and constructs the optimizer.

## TorchTitan Kimi integration

The [Kimi configuration registry](../../models/kimi_k2_7/config_registry.py)
is the first TorchTitan integration. Its shared optimizer configuration:

- Selects matrix parameters from attention, dense MLPs, routed and shared
  experts, and routers for DistributedMuon. Other parameters continue to use
  AdamW.
- Defines each selected parameter's compute layout, including per-head Muon
  for compatible attention projections.
- Groups layers into buckets so compute-ready work can overlap packed
  redistribution.

The configuration is shared by the Kimi-family, Kimi-VL, and Moonlight
recipes in that registry.

## Package boundary

FlexShard currently lives in TorchTitan while its API matures. We intend to
annex this directory into a standalone Python package and repository.

Keep this directory self-contained and PyTorch-only. Dependencies should flow
in one direction:

```text
TorchTitan components and models -> FlexShard -> PyTorch
```

FlexShard must not depend on TorchTitan model or training infrastructure.
