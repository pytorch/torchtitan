    """PyTorch Representation of the HuggingFace Dataset.

    Args:
        dataset_name (str): name of the dataset to load
        dataset_path (Optional[str]): Path to the dataset in the file system. If provided, data will be loaded from this path instead of downloaded.
        tokenizer (TokenizerIf): Tokenizer used to encode data. Tokenize must implement an `encode` and `decode` method.

        rank (int): rank of the current data parallel process
        infinite (bool): whether to loop infinitely over the dataset

    We currently support four datasets:
    alpaca (52K training entries)
    openwebtext (8M training entries, same type of data for entire dataset)
    c4 (177M training entries - this dataset is streamed due to the size)

Thursday, September 22nd join World Class BBQ Champion, Tony Balay from Lonestar Smoke Rangers. He will be teaching a beginner level class for everyone who wants to get better with their culinary skills.\nHe will teach you everything you need to know to compete in a KCBS BBQ competition, including techniques, recipes, timelines, meat selection and trimming, plus smoker and fire information.\nThe cost to be in the class is $35 per person, and for spectators it is free. Included in the cost will be either a t-shirt or apron and you will be tasting samples of each meat that is prepared.',
