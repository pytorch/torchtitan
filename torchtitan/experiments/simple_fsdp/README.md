## SimpleFSDP

This folder includes an experimental frontend implementation for [SimpleFSDP: Simpler Fully Sharded Data Parallel with torch.compile](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00284). SimpleFSDP is a compiler-based Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) framework, which has a simple implementation for maintenance and composability, allows full computation-communication graph tracing, and brings performance enhancement via compiler backend optimizations.

### Enable SimpleFSDP Training

```bash
CONFIG_FILE="./torchtitan/models/llama/train_configs/llama3_8b.toml" ./run_train.sh --model.name llama3_simple_fsdp --training.compile
```

### Composability Support

Some of the features require the updates from PyTorch, with which we are working on providing composability support for the following features:

| Feature | Support |
| :--------: | :--------: |
|Meta Initialization| ✅ |
|Activation Checkpointing| ✅ |
|Mixed Precision Training| ✅ |
|Tensor Parallelism| 🚧 |
|Context Parallelism| ✅ |
|Pipeline Parallelism| ✅ |
|Distributed Checkpointing| 🚧 |
|Float8 Training| ❌ |
