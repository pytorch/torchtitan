Deterministic RL training with vLLM experiment.

This experiment provides tools for bitwise-deterministic reinforcement learning
training using vLLM for fast rollouts and TorchTitan for training.

Key components:
- VLLMCompatibleFlashAttention: Flash attention with custom backward pass
- Qwen3VLLMCompatModel: vLLM-compatible model with merged projections
- batch_invariant_backward: Gradient support for vLLM's deterministic operations
- simple_rl: End-to-end RL training loop
