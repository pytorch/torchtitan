class LRSchedulersContainer(Stateful):
    """Container for multiple learning rate schedulers.

    This class is used to wrap multiple LRSchedulers into a single object that can be
    used to reduce the complexity of the training loop. This mimics the behavior of
    ``torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LRScheduler``. The design concept is the same as
    ``OptimizersContainer``. This class currently only supports ``LambdaLR``.

    **Note**
    Users who want to customize the lr_scheduler behavior can inherit from this class and
    extend the functionality as needed. The following methods must follow the same
    signature as ``torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LRScheduler`` class: ``step()``, ``state_dict()``,
    ``load_state_dict()``.

    **Limitations**
    This class assumes all the lr schedulers are the same. There is no easy way to support
    resharding for multiple different LRSchedulers because LRScheduler.state_dict() is not
    resharding friendly. Therefore, the limitation is used to allow TorchTitan to support
    lr scheduler resharding.

        We offer three types of learning rate decay schedules:
        1. `linear`: decays linearly from 1 to 0 over the decay period.
        2. `sqrt`: decays as 1 minus the square root of the decay progress.
        3. `cosine`: follows a cosine curve, decaying according to the values of the half-period of the cosine function.

        If `lr_min` is specified, the decay range is scaled from 1 to `lr_min`
        to ensure the learning rate does not drop below this minimum value.
