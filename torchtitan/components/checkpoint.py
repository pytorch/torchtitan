    Note: Pipeline Parallelism and Virtual Stages

    1. even for simple PP schedules, there is a separate optimizer each PP rank.
    rank0's optimizer would have a param_group[0] which refers to layers.0 in the original
    model.  rank1's would _also_ have a param_group[0], since it's index based, but
    referring to layers.1.  When saving, these collide and one of them is lost.  Then when
    reloading, only one stage can restore its optimizer states, others will error.

        The solution to this problem is optimizer flattening: it landed in #127071 and is
        enabled in TorchTitan by passing the 'flatten_optimizer_state_dict' kwarg to DCP
        functions called in the OptimizerContainer.
        See PR #127071 (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/127071) for the example of
        a flattening state_dict.

    2. With complex PP schedules, we have multiple model chunks per pp rank. This compounds
    challenge (1) by also requiring us to reason about multiple 'optim' objects locally.

        We solve this in the Model and Optimizer wrapper classes by flattening the state dicts
        from each object into one state dict before saving/loading. We rely on the individual
        state_dicts to not collide, which is guaranteed for the model by correct pipeline
        splitting and for the optimizer by the flattening support described in (1).

    3. LR schedulers also index model states like optimizers. Here we flatten the lr_schedulers
    with the assumption that all lr_schedulers have the same state_dict.

    Note: TorchFT checkpointing flow

    There are two types of checkpoints: when TorchFT is enabled: 1) the full persistent
    checkpoint, 2) the per-replica checkpoint.

    The full persistent checkpoint is saved by the replica with
    ``ft_manager.participating_rank() == 0``. It contains everything including the model,
    optimizer, lr_scheduler, dataloader, and train_state. Right now the full persistent
    checkpoint is loaded by all replicas. However, we can optimize it to only load if
    there are no other alive replicas.

    The per-replica checkpoint contains only the dataloader and is saved/loaded by all
    replicas to/from the its own folder. The folder name is prefixed with the ft_replica_id.

    Args:
        dataloader (DataLoader): The dataloader used to load the data.
        model_parts (List[nn.Module]): List of model parts to be optimized.
        optimizers (OptimizersContainer): The optimizers used to optimize the model.
        lr_schedulers (LRSchedulersContainer): The lr schedulers used to optimize the model.
