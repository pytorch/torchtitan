# torchtitan

`torchtitan` is currently in a pre-release state and under extensive development. Currently we showcase pre-training **Llama 3.1** LLMs of various sizes from scratch. To use the latest features of `torchtitan`, we recommend using the most recent PyTorch nightly.

`torchtitan` is a proof-of-concept for Large-scale LLM training using native PyTorch. It is (and will continue to be) a repo to showcase PyTorch's latest distributed training features in a clean, minimal codebase. torchtitan is complementary to and not a replacement for any of the great large-scale LLM training codebases such as Megatron, Megablocks, LLM Foundry, Deepspeed, etc. Instead, we hope that the features showcased in torchtitan will be adopted by these codebases quickly. torchtitan is unlikely to ever grow a large community around it.

Our guiding principles when building `torchtitan`:

* Designed to be easy to understand, use and extend for different training purposes.
* Minimal changes to the model code when applying 1D, 2D, or (soon) 3D Parallel.
* Modular components instead of a monolithic codebase.
* Get started in minutes, not hours!

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan
cd torchtitan
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install --pre torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu124 --force-reinstall
```

### Downloading a tokenizer

`torchtitan` currently supports training Llama 3.1 (8B, 70B, 405B) out of the box. To get started training these models, we need to download a tokenizer.model. Follow the instructions on the official [meta-llama](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B) repository to ensure you have access to the Llama model weights.

Once you have confirmed access, you can run the following command to download the Llama 3.1 tokenizer to your local machine.

```bash
# Get your HF token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

# Llama 3.1 tokenizer.model
python torchtitan/datasets/download_tokenizer.py --repo_id meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B --tokenizer_path "original" --hf_token=...
```

### Start a training run
Llama 3 8B model locally on 8 GPUs

```bash
CONFIG_FILE="./train_configs/llama3_8b.toml" ./run_llama_train.sh
```

## Multi-Node Training
For training on ParallelCluster/Slurm type configurations, you can use the `multinode_trainer.slurm` file to submit your sbatch job.

To get started adjust the number of nodes and GPUs
```
#SBATCH --ntasks=2
#SBATCH --nodes=2
```

Then start a run where `nnodes` is your total node count, matching the sbatch node count above.

```
srun torchrun --nnodes 2
```

If your gpu count per node is not 8, adjust:

```--nproc_per_node```

 in the torchrun command and

```#SBATCH --gpus-per-task```

in the SBATCH command section.
